# Bi-gram-Language-Model
In this Project I tried to create a simple bi-gram model and calculate its perplexity.

Problem Statement : The problem is taken from the LLM course of IIT Delhi
* Write a program to compute unsmoothed unigrams and bigrams.
* Run your n-gram program on two different small corpora of your choice (you might use email text or newsgroups). Now compare the statistics of the two corpora. What are the differences in the most common unigrams between the two? How about interesting differences in bigrams?
* Add an option to your program to generate random sentences.
* Add an option to your program to compute the perplexity of a test set.
